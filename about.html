    <H1> About the CH&FR Railroad</H1>
        <p>The Chestnut Hill &amp; Frost River Railroad is a fictional short line
railroad situated in the Appalachian Mountains, in present-day Southern
West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky.&nbsp; The railroad serves the towns
of Chestnut Hill, WV and Frost River, KY, along with the town of
Glover's Bend, WV.</p>
    <p>Note: Because this website is both a
(fictional) &#8220;prototype&#8221; corporate site and a site
  showcasing a model railroad, <span class="modelnote">this red italic
  font</span> is used in non-model-specific areas to indicate the
equivalent model version of the prototype information, or to indicate
  model-specific rules or information.</p>

<p>The main runs roughly from the (fictional) town of Chestnut
    Hill, near real life Thurmond, WV, Westward toward Huntington on a mix
    of owned track and trackage rights on the CSX/C&O Kanawha
    Sub. Once there, a branch line runs south to the (fictional) town
    of Glover's Bend (near real life Delbarton, WV), and the main follows
  the old (now abandoned) C&O main from Huntington toward Lexington,
  KY. The line terminates at (ficitional) Frost River, KY, which is
  either somewhere between (real life) Paris and Winchester, KY along
  the CSX CC Sub, or at (real life) Burgin, KY along the NS CNO&TP
  First District. I haven't decided exactly where Frost River is, yet,
  and may just have it be both...</p>
    

<p>The CH&FR is modeled very loosely upon the real life RJ Corman
    Railroad, though considerable liberties have been taken with the
    story.</p>
    

<p>The railroad was founded on June 20, 1863, on the same day as West
 Virginia's birth, as the Chestnut Hill Logging Railroad, hauling
 timber out of the hills around Chestnut Hill. Later on, as its
 founder (James Chestnut) expanded his horizons, it merged with the
 Frost River Railroad, a coal and grain hauler working its way
 eastward into the Eastern KY coal fields. It is the second oldest
 continuously operating railroad in the US, after the Union
 Pacific. The railroad has always enjoyed a close working relationship
 with both the C&O and N&W railways, and later with CSX and NS, as
 much of its traffic is bridge or alternate-route traffic for the two
 Class 1's.</p>

<p>For a few years during the 1970s, the Chestnut and Frost families
(co-owners of the railroad) held a significant financial stake in the
Chessie System, and the CH&FR was considered an "operating partner" of
Chessie, though it was not actually merged into the larger
entity. During that time, the CH&FR relied heavily on Chessie for
locomotive power, as its own fleet was aging and funds were tight. As
the CH&FR's fortunes returned, they purchased many of the
leased/loaned Chessie equipment to replenish the fleet. To this day, a
number of the CH&FR's locomotives sport the colorful Chessie paint
scheme.</p>

<p>Today, the CH&FR interchanges with NS at Williamson, WV and
Danville, KY, and with CSX at Winchester and Ashland, KY, and
Thurmond, WV. The Frost River Locomotive Shops and Frost River Leasing
Company, subsidiaries of the CH&FR provide locomotive
maintenance/repair/rebuilding and leasing services (respectively) for
the CH&FR and for client railroads.</p>

<p>Primary revenue sources include coal, timber, and chemical products
origination in WV and Eastern, KY, plastics, grain and other
industrial products in Central KY, and bridge traffic between CSX and
NS throughout the route..</p>
