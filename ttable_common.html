<h3>2.1 Standard Clocks, Bulletin Books and Train Registers</h3>
<p>
The Standard Clock, Bulletin Book and Train Register are kept at the
locations indicated in the subdivision-specific sections of the timetable. All clocks are kept at a 1:1 clock ratio,
unless otherwise specified by the Train Master.</p>

<div class="modelnote">The Standard Clock is the JMRI Fast Clock
running on the train room computer.</div>


<h3>2.2 Train Register</h3>
<p>
All Track Warrants and Train Orders shall be recorded in the Train
Register. Trains not listed in the Timetable shall not be
permitted to operate outside of Yard Limits without a proper Track
Warrant or Train Order.</p>
<p>
Train and Work Crews are responsible for reviewing the Train Register
prior to beginning work, and for recording their operations as
necessary in the Train Register.</p>

<div class="modelnote">The Train Register is on the train room computer.</div>

<h3>2.3 Standard Car Length and Track Capacities</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Standard Car Length</h4>
<p>
The Standard Car Length for measuring approximate capacities of
sidings, spurs, stub and yard tracks on the CH&amp;FR is the 50-foot
boxcar.</p>

<div class="modelnote">A 50-foot Boxcar in N scale is 3-3/4 inches.</div>


<h4>2.3.2 Track Capacities (Definition)</h4>

<p>Track capacities shall be specified in <span class="modelnote">(scale)
</span>feet and standard car lengths.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Position and Operation of Switches</h3>

<h4>2.4.1 Normal Position</h4>
<p>
The &#8220;normal&#8221; position of all switches shall be &#8220;Lined for Main&#8221;.
All switches will be returned to their normal position after each train
has passed, unless the Dispatcher, Train Master, Train Orders or Track
Warrant provides specific instructions otherwise.</p>
<p>
The "normal" position of switches is indicated by a green marker, and
the "reverse" or "thrown" position is indicated by a red marker.</p>
<p>
Operation of Switches under remote Dispatcher Control are the
responsibility of the Dispatcher. Train Crews shall not manually
or remotely change switch settings without receiving prior permission
from the Dispatcher. This permission may be granted as part of a
Train Order or Track Warrant.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 Calling Switch Positions</h4>
<p>
The position of all switches will be called by the Conductor at least 4
(four) car lengths prior to the switch and confirmed by the Engineer.</p>

<h4>2.4.3 Clearance of Switches</h4>
<p>
Clearance points for switches are indicated by yellow markers. No
train equipment shall be placed closer to the switch frog than the
clearance point marker, except briefly as part of an ongoing switching
move.</p>

<h3>3.1 General</h3>
<p>
No train shall occupy the Main Line without appropriate
authorization, by Timetable, Train Order, Track Warrant, or explicit
directive by the Train Master. Operations within Yard Limits may
be authorized independently by the designated Yard Master.
Operations on branch line running tracks may be authorized by Train
Order or Track Warrant.</p>

<h3>3.2 Yard Limits</h3>
<p>
Yard limits extend from &lt;insert loctation&gt; to &lt;insert location&gt; at
Frost River Yard. </p>
<p>Yard limits extend from Crossover 1 (MP 59) to Crossover 5 (MP 61) at
Nolan Yard. </p>

<p>
Trains entering or exiting the yard shall proceed at Restricted speed
until the entire train has cleared the yard limits.
Trains may not exit Yard Limits without a clearance and a valid Track
Warrant from the Dispatcher.
Yard Crews must obtain clearance from the Dispatcher before using the
main line for switching operations.
Main line trains must follow their Track Warrant when passing through
Yard Limits on the main.</p>

<h3>3.3 Passenger Stations</h3>

<p>Passenger stations are listed in the individual subdivision
sections.</p>
<p>Trains will exercise caution when passing passenger stations.</p>

<h3>3.4 Whistle / Horn and Bell Instructions</h3>
<div class="modelnote">Note: Non-sound-equipped
trains are exempt from audible signaling requirements.</div>

<h4>3.4.1 General Whistle / Horn Use</h4>
<p>
All Train Crews shall use the bell and whistle / horn as listed below.
"O" indicates a short whistle/horn blast, and "-" indicates a long

<p>
Other Rule 14 signals not listed here may be used at the Engineer's
discretion.</p>

<p>
Rules 14(b) and 14(h) may be omitted for brief stops and reversals
during otherwise continuous switching operations. The
whistle/horn should be used when resuming motion after any significant
stop. The meaning of "significant" is left to the Engineer's
discretion, always consistent with GOR#1.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Bell use</h4>
<p>
The bell shall be rung under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When starting from a stop, until the train is fully in motion</li>
  <li>At all grade crossings, especially in Level One Quiet Zones and
Times</li>
  <li>When approaching or departing a Passenger Station</li>
  <li>Any time nearby people should be alerted to a train in motion
(See GOR#1)</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4.3 Quiet Zones and Times</h4>
<p>
Train Crews shall observe Quiet Zones and Times as listed below or
indicated in Bulletins, Train Orders, Track Warrants or other
Dispatcher instructions. </p>

<div class="modelnote">Master sound volume should be controlled by the
Train Master or his designee only.</div>
<p>
At all times, GOR#1 takes precedence, and Train Crews shall use the
whistle/horn and bell as necessary to ensure the safety of personnel or
civilians, regardless of established Quiet Zones or Times.</p>
<p>
Levels of Quiet Operation are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level One: Bell only at crossings unless vehicles or
pedestrians are approaching</li>
  <li>Level Two: Bell only</li>
  <li>
    <div class="modelnote">Level Three: No sound effects unless
headphones are in use.</div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.5 Speed Restrictions</h3>

<h4>3.5.1 General Speed Limits</h4>
<p>
Unless otherwise posted, all freight operations are limited to 50
MPH and Passenger operations are limited to 79 MPH on CH&amp;FR
tracks.</p>
<p>
All speed limits are MAXIMUM speeds. Trains should not
proceed faster than prevailing weather and track conditions permit, at
the Engineer's best judgement, in keeping with General Operating Rule
#1.</p>
<p>
Crews must also observe speed restrictions imposed by the equipment and
rolling stock being used on their specific train.</p>
<p>
In any case where two applicable speed limits conflict (e.g. a signal
limit is lower than the speed limit indicated in a Track Warrant), the
lowest applicable speed limit shall be followed.</p>

<h4>3.5.2 Passenger Stations</h4>
<p>
Speed limit at passenger station locations is 20mph.&nbsp;
Engineers should exercise caution, watching for dangerous conditions
with passengers and station crew in the vicinity.</p>

<h4>3.5.3 Speed Restrictions by Signal Aspect</h4>
<p>
In Signaled territory, speed limits shall be as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>
Specific rules on Signal Aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On RESTRICTED aspect, the train must be prepared to stop short of
any track obstructions.</li>
  </li>
  <li>On STOP aspect, the train must come to a full stop before
reaching the signal. After coming to a full stop, the train may
proceed at Restricted speed, prepared to stop for any track
obstructions.</li>
  <li>On ABSOLUTE STOP, the train must come to a full stop, and may not
proceed without explicit authorization from the Dispatcher or Train
Master. In CTC territory, a change of CTC signal to a
permissive aspect constitutes authorization to proceed at the
signal-indicated speed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.6 Historic Equipment</h3>
<p>
The CH&amp;FR operates a great deal of equipment designated as
Historic, but still placed in general revenue service. When
designated Historic equipment is in use, or Historic rolling stock is
part of a consist, Train Crews should check with the Dispatcher for
special handling and operating instructions. Examples of such
instructions may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operating speed limits</li>
  <li>Maximum coupling speeds</li>
  <li>Position restrictions within the train</li>
  <li>Special inspection, repair and maintenance procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any such special handling instructions must be strictly followed.
Crews may be held personally financially liable for violating such
instructions, unless GOR#1 applies to the incident.</p>
